I am Xinyu Yang (杨新宇), an undergraduate from [ACM Honors Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), [Zhiyuan College](http://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Yong Yu](https://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu). My research focuses on building efficient and robust machine learning models that can cope with complex real-world problems, whether result from the low latency, low energy and high accuracy requirements in applications such as autonomous driving and AR/VR, or due to various data distribution like out-of-distribution, label scarcity and imbalance. 

Currently, I'm a research intern at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/) and [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/), advised by Prof. [Song Han](https://songhan.mit.edu/) and Prof. [Chelsea Finn](https://ai.stanford.edu/~cbfinn/) respectively. During my junior year, I also had a wonderful time as an undergraduate researcher working with Prof. [Junchi Yan](https://thinklab.sjtu.edu.cn/) at SJTU ThinkLab.
